# OtsemPay - Digital Banking Platform

## Overview

OtsemPay is a digital banking platform built with Next.js 14 that provides comprehensive financial services including PIX payments, BRL/USDT cryptocurrency conversion, card payments, and KYC management. The application serves two user roles: customers who access banking features and administrators who manage the platform.

    - `GET /wallet/pending-sell-deposits` - List pending (admin)

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## Theme System

The app uses **next-themes** for light/dark mode switching:
- **Default theme**: Dark mode
- **Toggle location**: Header (customer layout) - sun/moon icons
- **Storage**: localStorage with `theme` key
- **CSS variables**: Defined in `globals.css` with `:root` (light) and `.dark` (dark) selectors
- **Color scheme**: 
  - Light: `#f8f7fc` background, `#1a1025` text
  - Dark: `#0a0118` background, `#f8f7fc` text
- **Brand colors**: Violet/purple gradients maintained in both themes
- **Components**: ThemeProvider (`src/components/theme-provider.tsx`), ThemeToggle (`src/components/theme-toggle.tsx`)

## System Architecture

### Frontend Framework
- **Next.js 14 with App Router**: The application uses the modern App Router pattern with server and client components. Route groups organize pages by access level: `(public)` for authentication pages, `customer` for customer-facing features, and `admin` for administrative functions.

### Component Architecture
- **shadcn/ui + Radix UI**: The UI layer uses shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives, configured in `components.json`. Components live in `src/components/ui/` and follow the "new-york" style variant.
- **Component Organization**: Custom components are organized by function - `auth/` for authentication, `layout/` for structural components, `modals/` for dialog components, and `brand/` for branding elements.

### State Management
- **Zustand**: Global UI state (modal visibility) is managed via Zustand stores in `src/stores/ui-modals.ts`.
- **React Context**: Authentication state uses React Context (`src/contexts/auth-context.tsx`) wrapping the entire application.
- **SWR pattern**: Some data fetching uses the SWR pattern for caching and revalidation.

### Authentication Flow
- **JWT-based authentication**: Tokens are stored in localStorage via `src/lib/token.ts`. The HTTP client (`src/lib/http.ts`) automatically attaches Bearer tokens to requests.
- **Role-based access control**: Two roles exist - ADMIN and CUSTOMER. Protected routes use `<Protected>` and `<RoleGuard>` components to enforce access.
- **Token refresh**: The auth context handles token validation and automatic logout on 401 responses.

### API Communication
- **Axios HTTP client**: Centralized in `src/lib/http.ts` with request/response interceptors for authentication and error handling.
- **API proxy rewrites**: Next.js rewrites in `next.config.ts` proxy `/auth/*` and `/pix/*` routes to the backend API.
- **Backend expects**: The API follows REST conventions with endpoints documented in `API_SPEC.md`.

### Form Handling
- **React Hook Form + Zod**: All forms use React Hook Form with Zod schema validation via `@hookform/resolvers`. The pattern casts resolvers to avoid TypeScript strictness issues.

### Styling
- **Tailwind CSS 4**: Uses the new CSS-based configuration with `@theme` directives in `globals.css`. CSS variables define the color system for light/dark mode support.
- **Class Variance Authority**: Button and badge variants use CVA for consistent styling patterns.

### Key Application Features
1. **Customer Dashboard**: Balance display, transaction history, PIX payments
2. **KYC Onboarding**: Multi-step form for PF (individual) and PJ (business) verification with CEP lookup integration
3. **Admin Dashboard**: KPIs, user management, transaction monitoring, banking integration
4. **Cryptocurrency**: USDT rate fetching, BRL/USDT conversion modals

## External Dependencies

### Backend API
- **REST API**: Backend runs at `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` (default `http://localhost:3333`). Endpoints include `/auth/*`, `/customers/*`, `/pix/*`, and admin routes.
- **Banking Integration**: The admin dashboard consumes banking data including balance (saldo) and transaction history (extrato).

### Third-Party Services
- **Didit**: AI-powered identity verification service for KYC. Simplified flow - user clicks "Iniciar Verificação" and is redirected to Didit for document + selfie verification. Backend endpoints: `POST /customers/:id/kyc/request` creates session and returns verification URL. Webhooks handled by backend at `/didit/webhooks/verification`. The KYC page (`/customer/kyc`) shows current status and allows starting verification directly without pre-filling forms.
- **ViaCEP**: Brazilian postal code lookup API (`https://viacep.com.br/ws/`) for address autocomplete in KYC forms.
- **Yahoo Finance**: USDT/BRL rate fetching via `/api/usdt-rate` API route that proxies to Yahoo Finance.
- **Fly.io**: Production deployment platform with Docker-based builds.

### UI Libraries
- **Lucide React**: Icon library used throughout the application.
- **Sonner**: Toast notification system configured in the root layout.
- **Framer Motion**: Animation library available for transitions.
- **date-fns/dayjs**: Date formatting utilities.
- **qrcode**: QR code generation for PIX and crypto receive addresses.
